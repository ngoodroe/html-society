  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>Welcome! We are a dedicated group of programmers who believe that the web is best when it is written exclusively in
    Hypertext Markup Language.</p>

  <p>
    The Society of HTML Purists is a small collective of developers, designers, and web enthusiasts who believe in the
    value of building websites with pure HTML. We appreciate the simplicity, clarity, and reliability that comes from
    writing code without unnecessary dependencies or distractions.

  </p>
  <p>
    We believe the web is at its best when it is fast, accessible, and easy to understand. HTML, on its own, offers
    everything needed to share ideas, tell stories, and present information. It loads quickly, works on any device, and
    doesn’t break with time or updates.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our goal is to promote a quieter, more focused web — one built on clean structure, meaningful content, and minimal
    complexity. We admire thoughtful markup, semantic tags, and pages that do one thing well.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether you're building a personal site, a digital zine, or a library of notes, we welcome anyone who finds joy in
    the
    fundamentals.
  </p>
